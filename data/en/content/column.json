Today, most trips to Georgia start in Tbilisi, often striking travellers as both reassuringly familiar and genuinely exotic. The name Tbilisi derives from the Old Georgian word &quot;Tpili&quot;, meaning warm and was given to the city because of the area&#39;s numerous sulfuric hot springs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Geography and climate</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Located in East Georgia, this city of approximately 1.5 million people sits within a large basin surrounded by hills. The tree-lined Mtkvari River winds through its streets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The summer months in Tbilisi are long, dry and hot and the winters are relatively cold.&nbsp;July is the hottest month with an average temperature of 24&nbsp;&deg;C.

Two other peaks rise above 5000m and 10 Georgian mountains are more than 4000m high and covered with snow and ice all year round.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Climate</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The mountains moderate the local climate by serving as a barrier against cold air from the north. They divide the country into two contrasting climatic zones: Western and Eastern Georgia.&nbsp;On the western Black Sea coast the climate is notably humid and warm. Even in midwinter, the average temperature is 5&deg;C (41&deg;F) while the average summer temperature along the coast is 22&deg;C (72&deg;F).&nbsp;The plains region to the east, blocked from the sea by the Suram Mountains, is more continental in climate with slightly hotter summers and cooler winters.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Lakes</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are few lakes in Georgia but they are glittering jewels, many nestled high in the mountains, the largest being Lake Paravani (37km2), and Lake Paliastomi (17.3km2). Paliastomi is an open saltwater lagoon. Boat trips can be arranged to experience the astonishing lake shore scenery. Rare birds can be seen winking amongst the peatland vegetation.

International tours saw it achieving worldwide recognition. The successful Kote Marjanishvili State Drama Theatre was founded in 1928 and also played a crucial role in the development of modern Georgian theatrical life.

As with its art, Georgian architecture has been influenced by many civilizations, all visible in the country&#39;s castles, towers, churches and city streets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Georgian architecture easily seduces its visitors and the Upper Svaneti region with its stunning mountain scenery and medieval type villages and fortifications, is no exception. The remote castle town of Shatili in Khevsureti is another popular destination to appreciate some the finest examples of medieval castle architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Georgia&#39;s ancient cave city, Uplistsikhe, is also a treasured site with a fascinating history from the Iron Age. The carved city developed into one of the chief political and religious centres of pre-Christian Kartli with temples dedicated principally to the sun goddess. At its peak Uplistiskhe housed 20,000 people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The arrival of Christianity was a critical influence on Georgian architecture with two major forms of ecclesiastical building developed here - the central domed structure and basilica. Sioni Church in Bolnisi and Jvari Monastery in Mtskheta are remarkable examples of early medieval church architecture in Georgia - you&#39;ll never forget stepping into these ancient sacred hilltop churches aglow with gold mosaics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The country&#39;s rich collection of eclectic architecture is intensified in Georgia&#39;s capital, Tbilisi - from its iconic old town dotted with medieval churches and galleried houses to grand Art Nouveau buildings with their curved motifs and iron-wrought ornamentation, the austere structures left over from the Soviet Union, and now some eye catching futuristic designs modernising the skyline.</p>",

A mosaic inscription in the Judean desert in Palestine is known as the oldest Georgian inscription ever found, dating back to the 433 AD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bolnisi Sioni Church, situated south of Tbilisi, also has one of the oldest (493 AD) inscriptions in Georgian while the oldest manuscript (864 AD) is kept in St. Catherine&rsquo;s Monastery on the Sinai Peninsula.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Georgian literature is one of the oldest and richest among the Christian world&#39;s literatures.

      "<p>Georgia has long formed a strategic cultural and geographic bridge connecting Europe and Asia. It&#39;s part of a network of trade routes known as the Silk Road that travellers and traders have been using for centuries - Patara Dminisi for example, was once a major caravan stop and is the site of the oldest human remains found outside Africa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Silk Road evokes a romantic era associated with caravans of camels tackling difficult journeys through wild landscapes. Nowadays, Georgia still offers myth-laden journeys through a staggeringly beautiful land - but getting to and around Georgia is much easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are entry points by road, sea and air. There are&nbsp; international airports at Tbilisi, Batumi and Kutaisi. There are direct flights to Tbilisi from many cities in Europe, the Middle East and Russia, and from a few Central Asian cities. A few international flights also go to Batumi and Kutaisi. Batumi serves Georgia&#39;s western regions while the airport at the capital, Tbilisi provides the main gateway to eastern Georgia. Georgian Airways is the country&#39;s privately owned flag carrier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several Turkish bus companies connect Turkey to Georgia, running from Istanbul, Ankara, Trabzon and other Turkish cities to Batumi, Kutaisi and Tbilisi.</p>",

The Caucasus, the country&#39;s granite backbone spread their majestic peaks against the sky like an ancient spine. In their shadows, spread out before you are crumpled velvet hills peppered with hilltop monasteries and a patchwork of woods, orchards and crops. The beauty of this place is intoxicating and the potential adventure it offers, thrilling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you get to Georgia, there are options for travelling around by air, rail, public bus or minibus, taxi and rental car. Tbilisi also has a cheap, easy to use metro system. Travel is simple between the main towns and cities but getting further out into the remote villages can require some planning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A special legal regime applies to the two occupied regions of Georgia - the territory of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia and the territory of the Tskhinvali region (the former South Ossetia Autonomous District) - including restricted points of entry. Before considering travels to these areas and to elsewhere in Georgia it is recommended that you check current information on the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia.</p>",

When the North Caucasian Bats people (relatives of the Chechens and Ingushes) began settling in Tusheti in the sixteenth century, they were granted lands in the Alvani Valley in exchange for their military service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Known to the local Georgians as the Tsova-Tushs, they have a high degree of assimilation and are typically bilingual using both Georgian and their own Bats languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Geography and climate</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Located on the northern slopes of the Greater Caucasus Mountains, Tusheti is bordered by the Russian republics of Chechnya and Dagestan to the north and east, respectively. The Georgian historic provinces Kakheti and Pshav-Khevsureti lie to the south and west</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tusheti is distinguished by deep river gorges that&nbsp; slice forcefully through these mountains, and unlike the other regions of East Caucasus, the slopes of Tusheti are blanketed in aromatic, virgin pine forests.</p>",

The Gelati Academy and Monastery was one of the biggest religious, educational, scientific and philosophical centers of Georgia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also numerous lesser known but intriguing historic and cultural landmarks dotted throughout Imereti. The Ubisa Temple is one of the most important examples of Georgian monumental painting while the striking Mgvimevi Monastery appears sculpted from the side of a cliff by butter knives. At Katskhis Sveti there are two mysterious churches built above a 40m high cliff. Thought to have been the home of hermit monks who came from the Middle East, they can only be reached by a testing climb up hanging stairs,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The colourful villages of Imereti also have a special charm, each with their unique characteristics to explore, from cool chambers of aging wine to the homes of pottery and Georgian cognac.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Borjomi-Kharagauli National Park is a must see for outdoor enthusiasts. One of Europe&#39;s true wildernesses, it covers more than 76,000 hectares of native forest and sub-alpine and alpine meadows, and is home to rare species of flora and fauna including lynx and golden eagle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sataplia Reserve is an example of Georgia&#39;s karstic landscapes and the magic that happens when water meets limestone - grottos and caverns with the most gorgeous display of stalactites, stalagmites and mineral rock curtains. Over 200 footprints from dinosaurs have been discovered here. When you go, be sure to check out the local museum.</p>",

In ancient times Samegrelo was a large part of the Kingdom of Colchis, featuring in Greek mythology as the rim of the world and the mysterious country where the Argonauts sailed in pursuit of the Golden Fleece. It was also in Colchis that the first Georgian money was minted &ndash; the Colchian tetri. In the 16th century, Samegrelo was ruled by Georgian dynasty, Dadiani, their castle-like palace can still be visited in Zugdidi.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Geography and climate</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The region is divided into a low-lying land to the west around the major seaport of Poti and a hilly northern section bordering Svaneti. The main rivers are the Rioni, Enguri and Tskhenistskali. The Kolkheti National Park covers a large area of the coastal plain within the region, with more than half the park made up of significant wetlands and lakes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zugdidi is the main city of the region and its administrative centre. The city of Poti on the Black Sea is the main port and trade centre of the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The climate of Samegrelo along the Black Sea coast is subtropical, with hot summers and mild winters.&nbsp;The average January temperature is around 7C&deg; while in July it commonly reaches 24C&deg;.</p>",

The bustling city also serves as an ideal stepping stone for getting to Svaneti or Abkhazia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For outdoors enthusiasts, boating tours, notably on Lake Paliastomi and the Pichori River are offered in the enchanting Kolkheti National Park, as well as diving, bird watching, hiking and horse riding. Samegrelo is also rich in karst limestone caves and a real paradise for speleologists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For travellers with a penchant for archaeology and architecture, there is plenty to see throughout the region. One outstanding attraction is the village and archaeological site of Nokalakevi. It is thought to be the site of the mythological city of Aia, capital of the Kingdom of Colchis.

It extends from the 3500-5000m high snowy peaks and glaciers of the Greater Caucasus through knife edge ravines and secluded lakes, south to lush river valleys and lowland plains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The city of Mtskheta is in an attractive setting in the south of the region, at the confluence of the Aragvi and Mtkvari Rivers where they have carved a passage through steep hills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The climate varies considerably from north to south but generally, winters in the region are cold and marked with a lot of snow. Summers in the lowlands are relatively warm while mountainous northern areas stay cool all year round.</p>",

Popular activities in the region include paragliding, ski-touring, snowmobile sightseeing tours, trekking and hiking, bird-watching, horse riding, mountain biking, white water rafting, fishing, mountaineering, rock climbing, camping and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gudauri is Georgia&rsquo;s main snow resort and a premier outdoors playground with over 50 kilometres of prepared runs. The resort offers four types of runs: slalom, giant slalom, super giant and downhill racing, with something for every skier from beginner to professional.&nbsp; Great snow coverage means the season runs from December to mid-April. Drop into the Khada Hut for a delicious meal and a welcome rest in the friendly atmosphere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This region is also the spiritual heart of the country and home to two of Georgia&rsquo;s greatest churches, Svetitskhoveli and Jvari.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Jvari Monastery stands solitary and sublime atop a hill overlooking Mtskheta. &nbsp;Here, the missionary St Nino herself erected a cross (&quot;jvari&quot; in Georgian) in the 4th century to mark the coming of Christianity to Georgia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Svetitskhoveli is the royal cathedral of Georgia, used for centuries for the coronation and burial of Georgian monarchs. Nearby, in a narrow limestone canyon is the Shio-mgvime Monastic complex . It was founded by one of the 6th century Syrian Fathers who lived here as a religious recluse in a dark cave for 20 years, praying and devoting himself to God.</p>",

      "<p>Hi Tika,&nbsp;I would like to thank you for the perfect and professional organization of my trip.Georgia is a marvelous country. I was deeply impressed by its beauty, especially the&nbsp;stunning variety of landscapes and its richness of tradition. Georgia has a great potential&nbsp;as a holiday destination for Europeans, especially for a target group interested in mountains&nbsp;and outdoor activities (hiking &amp; biking), maybe in combination with a stay at the Black Sea.&nbsp;At present Georgia is rather an insider tipp and thus hardly known as a holiday&nbsp;destination in Europe. The country needs to be promoted via important tourism fairs throughout&nbsp;Europe and cooperations with tour operators. However, I will share my positive experience with your country&nbsp;and with your agency with people in the tourism industry and by doing so I hope to contribute to&nbsp;its promotion.&nbsp;And last but not least I would like you to extend my sincere thanks to Levan. He is a fantastic guide with a broad knowledge of your country&#39;s history and tradition. He does his job very professionally, conscientiously and with a lot of passion and dedication. I appreciated his company very much!I thank you also for the warm welcome and the delicious lunch at your house! A very special treat I shall never forget. It was a great pity I couldn&#39;t meet you personally.I wish you all the best and hope to be in contact with you soon again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Angelo</p>",

Also the availability of comfortable hotels to stay in.Now the hard, but enjoyable work of writing begins, and I may possibly trouble you with some questions.
