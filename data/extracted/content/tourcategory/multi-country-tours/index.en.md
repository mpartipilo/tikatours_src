The Caucasus region of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia is a well\-kept secret, a
feast for the eyes, a thrill for the adventurous and paradise for culture buffs.
A visit to this trio of mysterious, alluring, extraordinarily beautiful and wonderfully
welcoming countries will weave you between dramatic icy peaks, semi\-arid desert,
exotic modernising capitals, ancient castles and quaint villages with  traditions
as old and resolute as the land.

Armenia and Georgia are the two oldest Christian countries, while in the Islamic
Azerbaijan, the culture reflects Iranian as well as European influences. Fortresses,
monasteries, mosques and churches dot the landscape. Visit the Old City of Baku
in Azerbaijan, Armenia's laidback capital Yerevan, and Georgia's glorious countryside.
A Tika Tour to the Caucasus is perfect for those who like to get beyond the beaten
path and enjoy sumptuous hospitality.
