### History


Despite the sporadic invasions by the royal troops, historically, the highlander
communities of Khevsureti and the neighbouring areas enjoyed a degree of autonomy
from the royal authorities. Considered Georgia's best warriors, they defended the
borders and provided crack troops for the royal guards.

Their well\-preserved ancient traditions are a mix of Christian, Muslim, spiritualist,
and pagan beliefs. The Khevsur men dressed in chain mail, armed with broadswords
and wore garments decorated with crosses. They considered themselves members of
the army of the sacred flags and guards of Georgian kings and had a strict system
of physical training in martial arts \- that can still be seen in performances today
as the warrior dance, Khevsuruli.

### Geography and climate


Marooned in the mountains of the High Caucasus, Khevsureti borders Chechnya and is
included in the present day Mtskheta\-Mtianeti region.

It is a land of narrow mountain passes, remote valleys, emerald mountainsides emblazoned
with wild mountain flowers and glacial rivers. In winter, snow makes many of the
valleys inaccessible.

### What to see and do


The Chaukhi massive is on the border of the Khevsureti region and is one of the most
popular climbing and hiking areas in Georgia. Fit walkers must make the effort to
get to the Abudelauri lakes. It's a challenging hike along narrow rocky paths to
reach these three lakes, one blue, one green, one white, and well worth the effort.

Dozens of fortifications, sanctuaries and churches are scattered across the province.
The mountains are rich in slate, and these stone buildings blend naturally into
the mountains. Chief of these are the Khakhmati fortress, Akhieli fortress, Lebaiskari
fortress, Mutso fortress, Shatili fortifications, Gudani Cross, and the Anatori
Cross.

The village of Shatili has over 50 defensive koshkebi (towers) clinging together
on a rocky outcrop. Built between the 7th and 13th centuries, it was abandoned between
the 1960s and â€˜80s.

The ruined fortress village of Mutso is straight out of a fantasy movie. Located
on rocky hill at 1880 m above sea level, it is a warren of about thirty towers and
bone\-laden stone crypts.

At Korsha, 2km past the village of Barisakho, there's a small but interesting museum
of Khevsur life, with armour, weapons, traditional clothing and photos and well
worth a stop.
