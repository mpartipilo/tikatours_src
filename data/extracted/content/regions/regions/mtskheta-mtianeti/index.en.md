### History


The picturesque settlement of Mtskheta is one of the oldest continuously inhabited
settlements in the world. It was capital of most of eastern Georgia between the
3rd century BC and the 5th century AD, when that role was moved to Tbilisi.

However, Mtskheta has remained a spiritual capital for the country. The numerous
culturally significant monuments scattered around Mtskheta form a UNESCO World Heritage
site and are a reminder of its past glories.

### Geography and climate


This geographically diverse region represents a luscious slice of Georgia. It extends
from the 3500-5000m high snowy peaks and glaciers of the Greater Caucasus through
knife edge ravines and secluded lakes, south to lush river valleys and lowland plains.

The city of Mtskheta is in an attractive setting in the south of the region, at the
confluence of the Aragvi and Mtkvari Rivers where they have carved a passage through
steep hills.

The climate varies considerably from north to south but generally, winters in the
region are cold and marked with a lot of snow. Summers in the lowlands are relatively
warm while mountainous northern areas stay cool all year round.

### What to see and do


Mtskheta-Mtianeti is the perfect place for adventure seekers. Popular activities
in the region include paragliding, ski-touring, snowmobile sightseeing tours, trekking
and hiking, bird-watching, horse riding, mountain biking, white water rafting, fishing,
mountaineering, rock climbing, camping and more.

Gudauri is Georgia’s main snow resort and a premier outdoors playground with over
50 kilometres of prepared runs. The resort offers four types of runs: slalom, giant
slalom, super giant and downhill racing, with something for every skier from beginner
to professional.  Great snow coverage means the season runs from December to mid-April.
Drop into the Khada Hut for a delicious meal and a welcome rest in the friendly
atmosphere.

This region is also the spiritual heart of the country and home to two of Georgia’s
greatest churches, Svetitskhoveli and Jvari. The Jvari Monastery stands solitary
and sublime atop a hill overlooking Mtskheta.  Here, the missionary St Nino herself
erected a cross ("jvari" in Georgian) in the 4th century to mark the coming of Christianity
to Georgia.

Svetitskhoveli is the royal cathedral of Georgia, used for centuries for the coronation
and burial of Georgian monarchs. Nearby, in a narrow limestone canyon is the Shio-mgvime
Monastic complex . It was founded by one of the 6th century Syrian Fathers who lived
here as a religious recluse in a dark cave for 20 years, praying and devoting himself
to God.
