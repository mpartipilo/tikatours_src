### History


As with much of western Georgia, Guria was once part of the legendary Kingdom of
the Colchis tribe. Roman coins from the 3rd\-4th centuries have been found here
and the remains of ancient burial mounds have also been found in the dunes along
the Black Sea. During the Middle Ages this part of Georgia was an independent principality
governed by the Gurielis.

Gurian people were very good horse\-riders and participated in Buffalo Bill's Wild
West Show. They traveled to Europe and America numerous times, starting their performances
with Georgian songs and dances,

### Geography and climate


Guria is bordered by Samegrelo to the north\-west, Imereti to the north, Samtskhe\-
Javakheti to the east, Adjara and the Meskheti Mountain range to the south, and
the Black Sea to the west. It's capital is the town of Ozurgeti.

Much of the eastern lowlands of Guria are awash in wetlands and swamp forests including

mountains.
