Kakheti is the largest region in Georgia and particularly famous for its luminous
wines, postcard-perfect scenery and friendly people.

<div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6"><!-- 1554 -->

Snowy mountains soar above plains of corn, pomegranate orchards and relentless vineyards,
side by side in a wonderful tapestry - and everywhere you go, you’ll be invited
to share the perfectly fermented grapes.

### History


Kakheti is also rich in history. It was an independent or semi-independent kingdom
for long periods and here you’ll find the remarkable monastery complex of Davit
Gareja as well as many other beautiful, ancient churches and castles.

Of course, Kakheti has also played an important role in Georgia's history as the
cradle of wine, viticulture here having been traced back to VI millennium BC. Scientists
believe that the word Ghvino (wine, vin, vine) has Georgian origin.

### Geography and climate


Kakheti is bordered to the north by the small province of Tusheti and the majestic
Greater Caucasus mountain range, to the east and south by Azerbaijan, and to the
west by the province of Kartli. The incredibly diverse landscape of this eastern
region alternates between mountains, valleys and semi-deserts. The pretty town of
Telavi is the largest in the region with a population of around 30,000.

The coldest months in Kakheti are January and February. On the plains, the lowest
temperatures will hover from -2 °C to 3 °C, while in the mountains it can drop to
-16 °C. The hottest months are July and August when the average temperature at Alazani
Valley is around 24 °C.

### What to see and do


The town of Telavi is set in the vineyard-strewn Alazani Valley, at the foot of the
Gombori Mountains. It’s a great base for exploring Kakheti's historical, architectural
and viticultural treasures.

Immerse yourself in the outdoors - learn to fish for wild trout on the river Alazani,
go rafting or horse riding. Bird and wildlife watching opportunities are also exceptional
in the region's national parks, including some rare and threatened species.

Sheltering in gladed cypress woods near Telavi are the ruins of the old academy,
Ikalto. A religious and educational center during the middle ages, viticulture and
wine making were among the subjects studied here and the winery and cellars make
up a significant part of the complex.

At the northern end of the Alazani Valley, the distinctive turret-shaped spire of
the 11th-century Alaverdi Cathedral, soars 50 metres above the valley floor. The
interior is just as celestial.

Kakheti is also famous for the Davit Gareji monastery, a UNESCO World Heritage site
founded in the 6th century and  skilfully sculpted from the skin of a mountain.
It is one of Georgia's most significant historic sites.

Sighnaghi is the prettiest town in Kakheti, sitting astride a hilltop, flush with
18th- and 19th-century architecture and wonderful views. And of course, it's the
setting for one of the biggest autumn wine festivals - not to be missed.
