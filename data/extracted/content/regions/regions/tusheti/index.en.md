In the past, Tushetian Gouda cheese and its high quality wool have been famous and
were exported to Europe and Russia. Even today sheep and cattle breeding is the
leading sector of the economy.

### History


The first inhabitants of Tusheti were the pagan Georgians from Pkhovi who took refuge
in the mountains during their rebellion against Christianisation in the 330s. Eventually
however, they were forcibly converted to Christianity by the Georgian kings.

After the collapse of the unified Georgian monarchy, Tusheti came under the rule
of Kakhetian kings. When the North Caucasian Bats people (relatives of the Chechens
and Ingushes) began settling in Tusheti in the sixteenth century, they were granted
lands in the Alvani Valley in exchange for their military service.

Known to the local Georgians as the Tsova\-Tushs, they have a high degree of assimilation
and are typically bilingual using both Georgian and their own Bats languages.

### Geography and climate


Located on the northern slopes of the Greater Caucasus Mountains, Tusheti is bordered
by the Russian republics of Chechnya and Dagestan to the north and east, respectively.
The Georgian historic provinces Kakheti and Pshav\-Khevsureti lie to the south and
west

Tusheti is distinguished by deep river gorges that  slice forcefully through these
mountains, and unlike the other regions of East Caucasus, the slopes of Tusheti
are blanketed in aromatic, virgin pine forests.

### What to see and do


One of the most ecologically pristine regions in the Caucasus, Tusheti is a popular
and well established mountain\-trekking venue.

The area is also an idyllic setting for travellers interested in botany, birds and
wildlife. The severe climate and giant massifs have resulted in unique varieties
of vegetation and its endemic plants will be of great interest to the botanist.
As the snows melt and the temperatures begin to thaw, the blossoming of the Caucasian
rhododendron, huckleberry, crowberry and other plants carpeting Tusheti's hillsides
is a magnificent sight.

Tusheti has always been renowned for its biodiversity. Its thick forests and rocky
peaks are the safe habitat for birds and animals from black grouse and ring\-dove,
to Caucasian goat and bear, and the rivers are full of wild trout.

A tour around the delightful mountain villages in Tusheti, built in a traditional
style of architecture, also makes for a lovely day of sightseeing.
