Upon your arrival into Tbilisi Airport (Georgia’s main international airport), we
meet you to take you to Signagi located in the Kakheti region. Renowned for its
excellent wine the region combines the cultural appeal of ancient churches in the
vast valleys and old\-world charm with the snow\-capped Caucasus range.

of the Gombori Range of the Caucasus Mountains, Signagi is one of the smallest towns
in the country. Rich in ancient culture, the Caucasus is mentioned in ancient Greek
mythology and in the Bible. A large variety of languages and nationalities mingle
with the unique mountain landscape to make the Caucasus one of the most breathtaking
places on the planet.

homemade wine and Georgian Chacha (vodka), and try famous Georgian barbecue called
mtsvadi.

After breakfast drive to Telavi, one of the oldest towns of the Kakheti region. Numerous
monuments of historic and archaeological significance are found in the outskirts
of the city. After a city tour in this magnificent place, visit two of the most
important and most beautiful architectural monuments: the Dzveli (old) and Akhali
(new) Shuamta Monasteries. Both stand in a forest of deciduous trees, which makes
them look even more fascinating. After lunch enjoy a wine tasting at Tsinandali,
a historic winery in an estate which once belonged to the 19th\-century aristocratic
poet Alexander Chavchavadze. Discover the great wine\-making tradition of eastern
Georgia and learn the history behind the powerful family who left a lasting mark
on Georgian culture. Continue your drive into the Caucasus, arriving to Gudauri
and the Marco Polo Hotel Gudauri. Surrounded by majestic mountain peaks and stunning
valleys, Marco Polo Hotel Gudauri is a sight to see.

### Days Four\-Seven: Gudauri


â€‹â€‹Spend the next four nights in your mountain retreat at Marco Polo Hotel. All
year round there is much to do and see here. The endless snow covers the expanses
of the Caucasus, allowing visitors to really appreciate the beauty of the rugged
mountains and to make the most of their sporting and travel experiences. During
the winter months, you can ski on the southern slopes of the Greater Caucasus Mountain
Range down a number of tracks with ranging difficulties. During the warmer months

the stunning landscape. Guests can also unwind at a yoga class, on a photo tourism
activity, or during a relaxing spa treatment.
