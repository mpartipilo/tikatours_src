Welcome to Svaneti, an extraordinarily beautiful land of towers, snow\-topped craggy
peaks, wine and dancing. It is a place where time has not merely stopped, but rather
simply never existed. The entire region is a UNESCO heritage site, so remote that
it was never occupied by foreign invaders who could have plundered its treasures.

Svaneti’s medieval\-type villages are highly preserved and full of historic significance.
Churches date back to the 9th Century, richly decorated with wall\-paintings, chased
icons and altar crosses supplied by local workshops of their time. The unique tower
houses, once built for defence, are also fantastic examples of ecclesiastical architecture.

Hiking is a fantastic way to discover this magical region and our fully guided tour
will not fail to amaze with unforgettable panoramas, delicious local food and wine,
and a multitude of places steeped in history.
