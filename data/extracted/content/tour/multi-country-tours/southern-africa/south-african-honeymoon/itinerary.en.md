WELCOME TO TIMBAVATI PRIVATE NATURAL RESERVE!

As dawn breaks over the African bush, a gentle tap on your door will wake you to
the delights of a new day. Your ranger will discuss what you hope to see that day
over fragrant tea or coffee and morning biscuits or rusks. Ngala Private Game Reserve
is home to all of the Big Five, but is particularly well known for its prides of
lion and occasional sightings of African wild dog, as well as large herds of elephant
and buffalo. Venture out in search of leopard or lion sleeping off the exertion
of the hunt from the night before.

followed by a selection of hot breakfast dishes. Choose from eggs, oats, waffles
or a number of other option

by your ranger, who will share his insight into the smaller animals and vegetation
in the area before returning in time for lunch.

**Afternoon Tea**

Cool off with a refreshing dip in the sparkling swimming pool, indulge in an afternoon
siesta or simply watch the wildlife from your private veranda. Over a late afternoon
tea, your ranger will discuss what you hope to see during the afternoon/evening
game drive.

**Evening Game Drive**

This game drive begins in the late afternoon and lasts until after dark, when spotlights
are used for a glimpse into the nocturnal bush life. Drive down to the Timbavati
River to watch the animals drink and bathe or watch out for predators getting ready
for the hunt. Enjoy sundowners in a scenic location as the sun slowly sinks beneath
the horizon.

Return to your lodge for a mouthwatering dinner beneath the magnificent African sky.

NGALA TENTED CAMP

in tranquil bush surrounds. Its luxurious tented suite is set on raised platforms
with outdoor showers, baths mounted on rough\-hewn wooden bases, swirling overhead
fans, air conditioning, electric blankets for winter and private wooden decks. The
overall essence is African, with warm, earthy tones used throughout.. Mature indigenous
shade trees form a luxuriantly cool canopy overhead and elegant guest areas overlook
the seasonal Timbavati River. The camp’s lap pool, which follows the contours of
the riverbank, is perfect for idle afternoon game viewing, while a massage sala
adds a touch of pure indulgence. The food at Ngala is as individual and inventive
as the camp itself. Private lunch platters are savored on the viewing decks, at
the poolside or on the lush lawn.

open air meals throughout the day. Set deep in cleverly created patches of shade,
comfortable loungers beckon guests to relax around the pool while drinking in the
ocean views.

as well as toast, jam and hot dishes cooked to order.

**Morning**

Enjoy a delicious castaway picnic, set up in the middle of the soaring sand dunes,
where it’s easy to believe that you’re the only people on this magical island getaway.
Return to the shade of your casita for an indulgent afternoon siesta on your private
veranda or a relaxing treatment in the massage sala.

**Breakfast**

Paddle gently offshore in a sea kayak, keeping a sharp eye out the rare and mysterious
dugong. If you’re lucky, you may be joined by a friendly pod of dolphin. If you’re
feeling energetic, end the afternoon with a sprightly canter along the beach with
the island’s horse riding instructor. If you’re not, opt to go for a sunset dhow
cruise and enjoy the shimmering sight of the sun slipping beneath the ocean waves.

**Dinner**

There’s just enough time to relax before a succulent seafood dinner, served right
on the beach, with your toes in the sand. Retire to your comfortable bed, where
the gentle sounds of the surf will quickly lull you to sleep.

BAZARUTO ARCHIPELAGO

Awaiting you in a lush island forest is your own private casinhas (little house).
The casinhas boast a light and airy colour scheme that combines tropical chic with
a distinct African feel and reminders of the area’s Portuguese heritage. An ensuite
bathroom is located on one side of the bedroom and a small sitting area is located
on the other side of the bed. The casinhas offer private timber decks and cool rim
flow pools. There is also a private sala with a hanging daybed, as well as private
sun loungers situated on the beach. Bathrooms feature generous tubs big enough for
two, while al fresco showers are decorated with hand\-painted tiles. Woven hammocks
invite guests to an afternoon siesta, lulled by a chorus of songbirds that makes
the forest canopy its home. A shaded gazebo provides the ideal venue for starlit
dinners, while the stylish dining room and open lounge, both of which boast wide,
sunny decks, are the setting for more social dining.
