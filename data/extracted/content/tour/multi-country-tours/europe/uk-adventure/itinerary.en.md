Westminster Abbey, Big Ben — are instantly recognizable landmarks. Of course, the
choice of restaurants, bars, and clubs is legion in London, and what’s not to love
about a city with more lush parkland than any other world capital? As the saying

**ACTIVITIES IN LONDON**

### DAY ONE | WELCOME TO LONDON MEETING @ 4PM


London is full of possibilities, but with so much on offer, it can be an intimidating
to plan what to see in London and how to get around. This personalized 2-hour experience,
led by a local docent, is the perfect introduction for newcomers to London, and
is designed to answer practical questions about life in the UK's capital city.

Your experience begins in your hotel lobby where a docent, a resident of and expert
on all-things London, will explain the geographical layout of the city and how this
relates to the area where you are staying. They will discuss your itinerary and
help you make any last-minute plans, as well as answer all your questions, from
what is the best day to visit certain museums and monuments to how the London Underground
works. The docent will bring along maps and guidebooks to the city to help you get
acquainted with the places and things that you will be seeing, and will offer tips
on local customs and suggestions for dining, shopping, insider events, and concerts.

Next, you will then head outside for a stroll with your docent, allowing for a discussion
of the area’s history and an opportunity to absorb the neighborhood ambiance under
the guidance of a seasoned local. You will stop occasionally to talk about historic
buildings and monuments, or maybe to go over how the tube or 'Boris Bikes' work.
Your docent will point out the best markets and cafés, and certainly where the best
pubs for a relaxing pint can be found! The docent will leave you with maps, a little
bit of history, and a better sense of how best to navigate the sprawling metropolis
that is London.

###   
DAY TWO | FULL-DAY ROYAL LONDON EXPERIENCE


The Royal London walk is a perfect way to begin your time in London, and delve into
some of the most famed neighborhoods and landmarks. This private tour explores the
influence of the British Monarchy in London life. From historic traditions, to contemporary
celebrity, you’ll dig deep into the regal political and social relations that have
shaped the city over time. This experience, led by a local docent and historian,
will give you a rare opportunity to explore the interiors of Westminster Abbey and
Kensington Palace, stroll through Hyde Park, and take in the exterior of Buckingham
Palace. Along the way, you will receive an in-depth explanation of the role of the
monarchy, and the relationship between the royals and the public.

You’ll start with Westminster Abbey for a visit before the crowds arrive. Here you
will trace the lineage of kings, the intrigues of dynasties, and the impact of certain
key figures on politics, art, and science. As you move among the monuments, you
will trace a millennium of English history. You'll proceed to Buckingham Palace,
once a family home for George III and his wife Queen Charlotte and now the official
residence of Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh. You’ll touch
upon the architecture and symbolism of the building, and the stories behind the
monarchs who ascended to power within the palace. If your tour aligns with the Changing
of the Guard schedule, we’ll watch the ceremony outside of the palace.

You can continue with the Royal theme visiting St. James.' As we wander through this
area, we will walk in the footsteps of Kings and royal hangers-on. We will consider
the flamboyant lives of a number of our monarchs and hear about how today’s aristocracy
owes its existence to those habits. We will hear about the birth of the Gentlemen’s
Clubs and be entertained with anecdotes about the likes of The Athenaeum Club and
The Reform Club. In the beautiful St James’s Square we will hear about illustrious
past residents as well as the story of the development of the ‘London Square.’

After lunch in a local restaurant, we will proceed through Hyde Park. Avid sportsman
King Henry VIII loved to hunt deer and wild boar in the park. Today, with its magnificent
lakes, meadows, and foliage, it provides a quiet oasis within London. At the opposite
end of Hyde Park, we will find Kensington Palace, the current home of William and
Kate, and their children, George and Charlotte. Here we’ll learn about Royal London
in a real home. Stories of love, rebellion, and scandal are woven into the fabric
of the palace through theatrical performances, art installations, fashion, and music,
against the backdrop of the historic State Apartments.

After the tour, you are welcome to explore the grounds of Kensington Gardens even
further, or perhaps stop by The Orangerie for an afternoon tea, a fitting end to

**ABOUT DUBLIN**

A small capital with a huge reputation, Dublin's mix of heritage and hedonism will
not disappoint. Dublin is the capital and largest city of Ireland with a population
of 1.9 million people. It is an historical and contemporary center for education,
the arts, administration, economy, and industry. Dublin has a vibrant nightlife
and is reputedly one of Europe's most youthful cities, with an estimate of 50% of
citizens being younger than 25. There are many pubs across the city center and a
hub for small arts productions, photographic and artists' studios, and in the form
of street performers and small music venues. Beyond its impressive collection of
museums and galleries, and its choice of food from all four corners of the globe
– in both restaurant and market form – this is a city that embraces diversity and
has been transformed by two decades of multiculturalism. Dublin has been in the
news since the 9th century, and while traces of its Viking past have been largely
washed away, the city is a living museum of its history since then, with medieval
castles and cathedrals on display alongside the architectural splendors of its 18th-century
heyday, when Dublin was the most handsome Georgian city of the British Empire and
a fine reflection of the aspirations of its most privileged burghers.


**DUBLIN,  IRELAND: DAY-BY-DAY**

### DAY FIVE | ARRIVE IN DUBLIN + DUBLIN CITY TOUR


A guided Dublin City tour is the ideal introduction to “Dublin’s Fair City.” You
will visit the elegant Georgian squares, famous for its architecture and doors.
Highlights of the tour will be a visit to Trinity College, to view the 8th century
Book of Kells and the long room with its 200,000 books. No visit of Dublin would
be complete without a visit to St Patrick’s Cathedral. Built in 1192, it is one
of Ireland’s largest Cathedrals made famous by its former dean Jonathan Swift, author
of “Gulliver’s Travels”. Pass by Christchurch, built by the Anglo-Norman’s in 1172
to replace an earlier Church built by the Vikings in 1038, on your way to the Phoenix
Park with its many monuments including the Papal cross.

Next, you’ll head to lunch at Ireland’s oldest pub – the Brazen Head. The Brazen
Head is well worth a visit for both its historic value and its reputation as one
of Dublin's best Irish music venues. Dating back to 1198, The Brazen Head is officially
Ireland's oldest pub. Enjoy live music and wholesome food in any of the pubs' cozy
rooms. The brick outside hints at the age of the pub, and the low ceilings and the
kegs turned into bar tables make for a wonderful old style atmosphere that hasn’t
changed in years.

Full from your lunch, you’ll continue on to the Guinness Storehouse. The Guinness
Brewery in Dublin is Europe's largest stout producing brewery and home to the Guinness
Storehouse. Opened in 1904, the Storehouse was an operational plant for fermenting
and storing Guinness. Today it houses a very fine exhibition dedicated to the Guinness
story. Visitors will discover what goes into the making a pint of Guinness:  the
ingredients, the brewing process, the time, the craft, and the passion. The exhibition
shows how the brew has been marketed and how it is today sold in over 150 countries.
As a special treat, you’ll have an opportunity to enjoy the Guinness Connoisseur
Experience. Tucked away in a luxurious private bar, the Guinness Connoisseur Experience
is the ultimate Guinness tasting session for the ultimate Guinness fan. Join the
journey through the tastes, traditions, and stories of the four most popular variants
of Guinness – Draught, Original, Foreign Extra Stout, and Brewers Project (Dublin
Porter or West Indies Porter). The exclusive Guinness Connoisseur Experience lasts
about 1.5 hours.

Head to your hotel for some much needed relaxation after a busy day of traveling
around Dublin. At 6PM, meet your private chauffeur at the hotel lobby and transfer
to Merry Ploughboys Pub. The Merry Ploughboys live in concert is widely regarded
as the best traditional music show in Dublin and also as a must see for any visitors
to Dublin city. The show is a highly entertaining performance of live traditional
Irish music, song and Irish dancing. From start to finish, this is a show based
on fantastic interaction between the performers and the audience. Your private chauffeur
will be waiting for you to take you back to your hotel after the show at 10PM.


**The Westbury Hotel**

The Westbury not only surrounds its guests in luxury and style, it places them at
the very center of the city’s social and cultural riches. The hotel occupies a prime
position between Trinity College and St. Stephen’s Green; perfectly located for
exploring the most exciting sides of Dublin. At its front doorstep lies Grafton
Street, renowned for its color, street artists and luxury shopping; whilst Dublin’s
‘Creative Quarter’, a vibrant network of streets filled with lively bars, restaurants
and independent stores runs behind the hotel, with the city’s top theaters, museums
and art galleries all situated within a short walking distance. The magnificent
Gallery, with its captivating art collection and sumptuous Afternoon Tea is a Dublin
institution. Modern, edgy and sophisticated, the hotel’s restaurants, bars and meeting
spaces present a unique Dublin social hub.




### DAY SIX | THE COASTAL ROAD + HILLSBOROUGH CASTLE


After a full Irish breakfast at your hotel, you’ll depart Dublin with your private
driver / guide and travel north along the coast. Along the way, you’ll pass by Drogheda,
a historic town on the River Boyne with a bustling port town, excellent pubs, and
a good live music scene. It's known as the "Gateway to the Boyne Valley." Two of
Irelands most famous tourist attractions, the passage tombs at Newgrange and Knowth,
are just a few miles away. Let your driver know if you want to stop!

Continue on the scenic drive on the Coastal Road on your way to Annagassan, where
you will enjoy lunch at the Glyde Inn. The Glyde Inn is famous for linn duachaill,
a famous Viking Longport located in an area of outstanding natural beauty overlooking
the Cooley and Mourne Mountains. The Glyde Inn is a modern restaurant with the charm
of the authentic traditional establishment. It offers legendary views of Dundalk
Bay and Cooley/Mourne Mountains, while award-wining chefs serve amazing food.

After lunch, continue via the Coastal Road towards Cooley Peninsula. Forested slopes
and sun-dappled, multihued hills rise above the dark waters of Carlingford Lough
cleaving the picturesque Cooley Peninsula. Country lanes wind their scenic way down
to deserted stony beaches, while sweeping views stretch north across the water (and
border) to the majestic Mourne Mountains. The medieval village of Carlingford is
an ideal base. From here, you can continue along the coast road past the village
of Omeath to Newry, at the nexus of Counties Down and Armagh in Northern Ireland.

Continue to Hillsborough Castle, where you will enjoy a private guided tour followed
by afternoon tea. Hillsborough Castle holds a unique place in the history of Northern
Ireland. Built in the 18th century, the castle has gone from being a simple country
house for the Hill family to becoming the official royal residence in Northern Ireland
and the place where many stages of the Peace Process happened. In 1934 a fire devastated
much of the house. Much of what we see today dates to this time. Hillsborough has
served as a venue for formal and informal stages of the Peace Process, including
the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985, decommissioning talks in 1999,
and the negotiation of the devolution of policing and justice powers in 2010 (The
Hillsborough Agreement). Leading members of the Royal Family have regularly visited
Northern Ireland since 1922, using Hillsborough as their ceremonial and personal
base. Significantly, the first meeting between HM The Queen and Mary McAleese, then
President of Ireland, occurred at Hillsborough in 2009. Wander through 98 acres
of beautiful gardens developed from the 1760s onwards, offering a contrast of ornamental
grounds, peaceful woodland, meandering waterways, and trimmed lawns. Look out for
the statue of Ossian outside the main entrance, the Lady Alice Temple, the Quaker
Burial ground and the Ice House.

Finally, transfer to your hotel and check in. Overnight and full Irish breakfast
at Culloden Estate & Spa.


**Culloden Estate & Spa**

Standing high on the slopes of the Holywood Hills, overlooking Belfast Lough and
the County Antrim Coastline, is the magnificent Culloden Estate and Spa, the most
prestigious luxury five star hotel in Northern Ireland. Originally built as an official
Palace for the Bishops of Down, the Culloden stands in 12 acres of beautiful secluded
gardens and woodland. Palatial surroundings, fine antiques, and the highest levels
of personal service combine to give the Culloden a unique air of elegance. Beyond
its lovely estate, Culloden is also renowned for its spa sanctuary, where treatments
fuse ancient rituals with modern holistic remedies. There are endless walking paths
through the estate’s stunning manicured gardens as well as along the coast.

###   
DAY SEVEN | LONDONDERRY + GIANT’S CAUSEWAY


A full Irish breakfast at your hotel precedes a morning drive along the Causeway
Coast towards Derry. The Causeway Coastal Route between the cities of Belfast and
Derry is a kaleidoscope of natural landscapes, imposing cliffs, bubbling mountain
streams, and gushing waterfalls. The route starts in Belfast and will take you through
the gorgeous Glens of Antrim. Along the route, check out the Gobbins, an Edwardian
marvel, while the magnificent Mussenden Temple stands at the edge of a sheer drop
overlooking Downhill Strand.

If you are interested, ask your driver to stop at Giant’s Causeway, a UNESCO World
Heritage Site that lies at the foot of the basalt cliffs along the seacoast on the
edge of the Antrim plateau. It is made up of some 40,000 massive black basalt columns
sticking out of the sea. The dramatic sight has inspired legends of giants striding
over the sea to Scotland. The property’s accessible array of curious geological
exposures and polygonal columnar formations formed around 60 million years ago have
also made it a ‘classic locality’ for the study of basaltic volcanism. The features
of the Giant’s Causeway and Causeway Coast site, and in particular the strata exposed
in the cliff faces, have been key to shaping the understanding of the sequences
of activity in the Earth’s geological history. The Giant’s Causeway has come to
be regarded as a symbol for Northern Ireland.

Next, take time to explore the city of Derry. Founded in the 6th century by St Columba,
Derry is the second largest city and port of Northern Ireland. Columba named it
“Doire” or “Oak grove” which was later Anglicized as Derry. In 1613 the city was
selected as a major plantation project, organized by the London livery companies,
and as a result it acquired the prefix London. In the same year the walls of Derry
were built to protect the town from the Gaelic chieftains in Donegal. A walk on
the walls is a must on any visit to Derry as they are among the best-preserved fortifications
in Europe. Rising to a height of 8m they are 9m wide in some areas. Today these
walls separate two communities, the Bogside – a Catholic ghetto with its famous
murals and the Waterside – a Protestant enclave. Derry has a heavy historical past
and has suffered a lot through violence. Today Derry enjoys the advantages of the
new peaceful atmosphere in Northern Ireland politics and its city center is again
lively and pleasant. You will appreciate a walk in the colorful and well looked
after historical city, which boast good shopping, pubs and cafes.

Exhausted from a full day or touring and exploring, you’ll be transferred back to
Belfast for your final night at Culloden Estate & Spa.

### DAY EIGHT | DEPART EUROPE + RETURN TO HOUSTON


After breakfast, you will be taken via private transfer to Belfast City Airport (BHD)
for your 12:10PM economy class flight to London Heathrow Airport. Upon arrival at
LHR (1:40PM), find your gate and board your 2:40PM flight to Houston’s Bush International
Airport. On this flight, enjoy Premium Economy Class seating.
