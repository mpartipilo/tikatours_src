The opportunity to listen to the breath\-taking harmonies sung by Georgian voices
is a magical experience. Georgian polyphony has a haunting, resonant vocal quality
and striking harmonic convergences unlike anything in European music.

Polyphonic music is deeply anchored in Georgian culture. Recognised by UNESCO as
part of the world's treasured living heritage, the distinctive sounds are still
heard today down cobbled city streets, across vineyards and around dining tables.

Every region of Georgia has its own specific musical dialect and style of performance
but they all share the same intonation and harmonic characteristics.

Georgian musical instruments can be overshadowed by the country's rich vocal traditions
but they are also important and often played to accompany polyphonic songs. Among
the most popular instruments are the larchemi (Georgian panpipe), stviri (flute),
gudastviri (bagpipe), changi (harp), chonguri (four stringed unfretted long neck
lute), panduri (three stringed fretted long neck lute), bowed chuniri (a fretless
viol) and a variety of drums.

After Christianity was proclaimed in Georgia, a new genre of church polyphony developed
which achieved great heights with the founding of music schools, particularly at
the monasteries of Gelati and Ikalto. Georgian historians and musicologists believe
that the Georgian language and polyphonic singing tradition must have been in use
in the church as early as the 7th or 8th centuries and was well established in Georgian
liturgy by the 10\-11th centuries.

As well as the older rural traditional polyphony and religious polyphony, there are
more recent traditions of urban music and urban polyphony. Being on the crossroads
between Asia and Europe, Tbilisi attracted an array of talented musicians with a
variety of backgrounds but predominantly of Middle Eastern ethnic origin. As a result,
eastern melodies began to appear in Georgian cities.

Another urban singing style appeared much later, influenced by the opening of the
Opera House in Tbilisi. Georgians became very enthusiastic about this new music
and many popular arias from Italian operas were adopted and rearranged in three\-part
urban a cappella style with Georgian lyrics. Later, the 1920s\-30s in Georgia were
marked by the development of chamber and symphony music.

Popular music has become well\-liked in the last few decades in Georgia, but the
traditional folk vocal music of the country continues to be extremely popular.

Tbilisoba is an annual October festival celebrating the diversity and history of
Georgia's capital and featuring open\-air concerts of traditional music and dancing
as well as various cultural events.

For jazz enthusiasts, the Black Sea International Jazz Festival held in the port
city of Batumi in July, is an annual highlight and attracts top musicians from around
the world.
