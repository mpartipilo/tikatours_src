An outpost of Eastern Europe that merges into western Asia, Georgia straddles historical,
cultural and geographical crossroads. Civilizations have collided in the Caucasus
since the dawn of history, creating a place so beautiful, so inviting, so intriguing

The cities boast mesmerising museums unfolding surprising secrets, dignified concert
halls, and home to splendid dance and theatre. Contemporary art and architecture

culture and traditions in the fields, the numerous and beautiful churches, the delicate
medieval frescoes and impenetrable fortresses, and around the generously laid  dining
table.
