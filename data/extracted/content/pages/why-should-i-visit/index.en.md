Few of the world’s small nations can offer the visitor as much as Georgia. Once experienced,
this country will stay with you forever. Inexpressibly exotic, views of arresting
pared back beauty, a deliciously prolific wine culture, sublime music and an astonishing
range of architecture from stone watchtowers and richly frescoed churches to charmingly
carved wooden balconies and the grandeur of Art Nouveau.

Georgia is where East meets West and ancient myth meets modern life. It bumps against
Russia in the Caucasus Mountains where it boasts some of Europe's highest peaks.
Its elegant capital is reminiscent of Paris. It enjoys beach resorts and a Mediterranean
climate on the Black Sea. And inland, green plains and valleys produce everything
from apples and avocados to walnuts and wine.

### Birthplace of wine

Wine\-growing has a very long tradition in Georgia. It’s impossible to imagine daily
life without it. With over 500 original grape varieties and a strong culture of
growing, it's no surprise that Georgian wine will match any in the world.

Georgia offers a smorgasbord of architecture and some its most unique examples can
be found carved directly into the rock. Visit the ancient town of Uplistsikhe on
the historic Silk Road, carved into sandstone hills or the large complex of richly
frescoed cave monasteries at David\-Gareji.

With an abundance of superb food and wine, Georgia has developed a strong tradition
of good cheer \- including a saying that the guest is the gift from God. Essential
to the table ceremony is the Tamada or toast\-master, guiding the mood of the meal
by introducing eloquent toasts at key moments.
