Georgia's complex history and location at an age\-old Eurasian crossroads has resulted
in an eclectic display of architecture and art. It was influenced during antiquity
by Mesopotamian, Anatolian, Greek, Persian, Roman and Byzantine traditions, then
by religion when Christianity was adopted.

From the 19th century onwards, Georgian art and architecture has evolved more within
the context of Europe and Russia as well as drawing from in its own deeply held
roots.

### Art

Early Georgian art includes examples of beautiful and skilfully crafted gold and
silver objects and jewellery dating to the 5th\-4th centuries BC which can be seen
in the National Museum.

Georgia also sports some of Europe's finest examples of medieval frescoes. The cave\-hewn
monastic complex of Davit Gareji dates as far back as the 6th century and housed
a once flourishing fresco school.

Carpet weaving in the Caucasus also dates back to the Middle Ages as does the art
of beautiful handcrafted cloisonne enamel. It is still a very popular form of ornamentation
in Georgia and a stunning collection can be seen at the Museum of Fine Arts.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, Georgian art underwent a strong, orientalist makeover
until the influences of Italy and Russia permeated in the late 18th century.

By the 20th century, Georgian art had developed its own style. Niko Pirosmani, perhaps
the most famous Georgian artist, studied in Paris and became known for his primitivist
style. His paintings are bright with childish lines conveying themes rooted in Georgian
folk culture.

### Architecture

Georgia is an architect's dream. As with its art, Georgian architecture has been
influenced by many civilizations, all visible in the country's castles, towers,
churches and city streets.

Georgian architecture easily seduces its visitors and the Upper Svaneti region with
its stunning mountain scenery and medieval type villages and fortifications, is
no exception. The remote castle town of Shatili in Khevsureti is another popular
destination to appreciate some the finest examples of medieval castle architecture.

Georgia's ancient cave city, Uplistsikhe, is also a treasured site with a fascinating
history from the Iron Age. The carved city developed into one of the chief political
and religious centres of pre\-Christian Kartli with temples dedicated principally
to the sun goddess. At its peak Uplistiskhe housed 20,000 people.

The arrival of Christianity was a critical influence on Georgian architecture with
two major forms of ecclesiastical building developed here \- the central domed structure
and basilica. Sioni Church in Bolnisi and Jvari Monastery in Mtskheta are remarkable
examples of early medieval church architecture in Georgia \- you'll never forget
stepping into these ancient sacred hilltop churches aglow with gold mosaics.

The country's rich collection of eclectic architecture is intensified in Georgia's
capital, Tbilisi \- from its iconic old town dotted with medieval churches and galleried
houses to grand Art Nouveau buildings with their curved motifs and iron\-wrought
ornamentation, the austere structures left over from the Soviet Union, and now some
eye catching futuristic designs modernising the skyline.
