The people of Georgia have a passionate and deeply rooted relationship with food
and wine. With their superb cuisine, heady, molten wines and unmatched hospitality,
you certainly won't go hungry - or thirsty while holidaying in Georgia. Take part
in a Supra and feast on local specialities such as the ubiquitous khachapuri (stuffed
flatbreads), shashlik (kebabs), and badrijani nigvzit (aubergines with walnut paste).

During a traditional Supra, not only will you enjoy the salubrious eating opportunity,
butÂ you will be expected to sample a world of wine. The birthplace of viticulture,
Georgia has the oldest unbroken tradition of wine making in the world, passing on
8,000 years of secrets. Almost every house still has a vine-covered trellis outside,
the grapes waiting to be pressed and fermented to create sensational organic wines.
