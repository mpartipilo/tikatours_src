Georgia is destination Romance. A fairy tale tapestry of sublime stone churches and
watchtowers, glacial alpine peaks, summer meadows and the caramelised vineyards
of late summer, Georgia is a stunning place to share with a partner. Have a Georgian
wedding amidst a landscape as vivid and intoxicating as Georgian wine  and experience
a day of romance and magic you'll never forget. Our team will immerse you in the
atmosphere of a genuine Georgian wedding, with traditional dancing, music and cuisine.

Why not combine your special day with a tour of Georgia. Walk hand in hand through
the bewitching web of old city lanes. Visit the most beautiful churches in Georgia,
with their exquisite carvings and frescoes. Explore the enchanting kaleidoscope
of snowy peaks, wood clad  slopes, ancient mysterious temples, fabulous palaces
and awe\-inspiring fortresses. After a day of sightseeing, there's no better way
to relax than a luxurious soak at Tbilisi's famous mineral baths.
