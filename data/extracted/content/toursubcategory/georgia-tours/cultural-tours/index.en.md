Not quite Asian, but not fully European either, Georgia is an intoxicating combination
of eastern and western influences and ancient beginnings. One of the earliest places
in the world to adopt Christianity, the country is also known as the birthplace
of wine and home of the ancient Greek myth of Jason and the Argonauts and their
search for the Golden Fleece. But Georgia was also home to some of our earliest
human ancestors, their remains dating back nearly 2 million years.
