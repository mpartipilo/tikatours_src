Situated between the West and East, Georgia is fast becoming one of the must\-see
destinations of our generation. Ancient churches and watchtowers rest in striking
green valleys and beautifully serene mountain landscapes that simply take your breath
away. In vast contrast, Georgia's cities have more recently welcomed impressive
new architecture and influences from the West.

The country is home to incredibly warm\-hearted and high\-spirited people, who claim
Georgia to be the birthplace of wine making. As well as incredible food and drink,
it is a land where travellers enjoy hiking, skiing, horse treks, paragliding and
many other outdoor activities.

If you aren't yet convinced, we challenge you to view these images and still not
want to go...
