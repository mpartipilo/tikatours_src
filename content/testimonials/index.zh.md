And Tika and George \- \- \- nothing can compare to your marvelous hospitality! Where
can I start? Your many kindnesses during our trip to the Republic of Georgia brought
an overwhelming feeling of appreciation to our hearts. You welcomed us like long\-not\-seen
family members into your own country home and gave us a lovely experience to be
long remembered \- \- \- and you sent us off with a farewell dinner as a lifetime
experience to be cherished \- \- \- the company, the dinner, the singers, the setting
\- \- \- incomparable. We are deeply grateful. I must tell you that we can not stop
singing Georgia's praises \- \- \- and we are startled at the lack of perception
of your marvelous country by so many of our friends and colleagues. If they only
knew first hand! We are urging them to go and experience Georgia for themselves.
With hearts full of appreciation for your kindnesses and your open arms,

Barbara and Alden Smith

Dear Eka and George,

First, let me apologize for the lateness of this email. I want to express my very
BIG THANK YOU!!!! Our trip in April visiting your beautiful country of Georgia was
just a fabulous experience!!! You exemplify the warm hospitality of the people and
country and I enjoyed every moment!! Each day there was something special to see/taste/experience
and the true highlight was meeting you and spending time together on our last day.
Thank you so much for the opportunity, the care, the attention, the view into yourculture…I
will never forget it. Since my return, I've been showing my photos and talking about
Georgia nonstop! I hope that I will be able to send you clients in the futurewho

Tika \- I just wanted to drop a quick note to say "thank you" for the lovely time
that was planned for me while I visited Georgia last week. Every aspect of my visit
was wonderful \- from the sites, fine food, and perfect guiding.I also enjoyed my
visit to neighboring Armenia, where everything was also nicely done.I look forward
to another visit in the near future \- perhaps after the new Kempinski opens in
Tbilisi \- which I will intend to supplement with a visit to Azerbaijan.Until then,
best wishes and thanks again for the hospitable welcome.

Best Regards\-

Thank you so much for the invitation to visit explore a new destination for us; GEORGIA!
What a lovely country. There was so much to see and experience. We loved Merab for
his patience and his touring expertise on the history, culture, sights and economy
of his homeland. The Marriott was spacious, comfortable and they have the most luxurious
sheets. The staff was very accommodating. The Caucasus mountain trip was an adventure!
The Rooms hotel is very fun. We loved the library, the great lobby, the bar and
music, the antique rugs, the interesting furniture, the meals and the accommodations
were very fine. The view is glorious! and to meet the “Tica” family on their personal
turf was very special! What a fabulous day walking the olive orchard, making Georgian
Snickers and dumplings. The feast was beautiful, plentiful and delicious! Thank
you for the Georgian Svanidze Wine! We shared it with family and friends for Easter.
It was so nice to meet George and Eka and dine at their wonderful restaurant and
at their home. What a great venue you planned for us.Thanks for all your hard work
in planning a very fine and interesting itinerary for us.

Until next time!

Sincerely,

bo

Hi Tika, I would like to thank you for the perfect and professional organization
of my trip.Georgia is a marvelous country. I was deeply impressed by its beauty,
especially the stunning variety of landscapes and its richness of tradition. Georgia
has a great potential as a holiday destination for Europeans, especially for a target
group interested in mountains and outdoor activities (hiking & biking), maybe in
combination with a stay at the Black Sea. At present Georgia is rather an insider
tipp and thus hardly known as a holiday destination in Europe. The country needs
to be promoted via important tourism fairs throughout Europe and cooperations with
tour operators. However, I will share my positive experience with your country and
with your agency with people in the tourism industry and by doing so I hope to contribute
to its promotion. And last but not least I would like you to extend my sincere thanks
to Levan. He is a fantastic guide with a broad knowledge of your country's history
and tradition. He does his job very professionally, conscientiously and with a lot
of passion and dedication. I appreciated his company very much!I thank you also
for the warm welcome and the delicious lunch at your house! A very special treat
I shall never forget. It was a great pity I couldn't meet you personally.I wish
you all the best and hope to be in contact with you soon again.

Dear Tika, George and Eka,

A very big thank\-you for all that you did to make my visit to Georgia so interesting
and so successful. Although it was just six days long we managed to cover 1200 km
and fit in all that I hoped \- and more. Throughout I felt safe, well guided and
the recipient of wonderful hospitality. None of that will surprise anyone who knows
Georgia of course, but it is an important discovery to convey to readers. Also the
availability of comfortable hotels to stay in.Now the hard, but enjoyable work of
writing begins, and I may possibly trouble you with some questions. In the mean
time renewed thanks for all your support and help.

My best,

Julian

How wonderful to receive your email, George, while we were in New York City for a
family Christmas trip. It brought back so many happy memories of you, your sister,
and your wonderful family and our most memorable trip to the Republic of Georgia
\- \- \- what an experience for us. We are still singing Georgia's praises to all
of our friends and business colleagues \- \- \-in fact, Travel & Leisure magazine
named Georgia one of the best places to have visited in 2015 and one to visit in
2016. Your country has truly gained a worldwide, marvelous reputation \- \- \- and
it is most certainly based on the outstanding hospitality that Georgians offer their
visitors.

Alden and I send all best wishes back to you all,

Barbara

Dear David and Tika\-

Thank you for a fantastic holiday in your beautiful country. We were truly amazed
at your side of the world. It was everything you promised us. The tour guide was
patent, knowledgeable and a beautiful person inside and out. The driver was seriously
the sweetest driver we have ever had on any of our trips. He was safe, courteous
and went above and beyond every chance he got. They were a great team and we believe
truly highlighted the Georgian people well.

The highlights of our trip include the first hotel, being able to wake up to the
Tbilisi city view was spectacular. They had a great breakfast with a beautiful view.
We loved Rooms hotel and the Mountain. Wow, was that impressive. We do not have
that in the US. We loved seeing the Georgian dancing. And all the food. So much
delicious food. The dinner with Katlino was also lovely. We really enjoyed a smaller
gathering and understanding more of a local view.

Those are just a few of the special moments we had. Thank you for everything.
