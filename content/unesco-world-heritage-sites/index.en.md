### Winemaking


![](/library/content/img27.jpg)

UNESCO has agreed that Georgia’s traditional winemaking method of fermenting grapes
in earthenware, egg\-shaped vessels called qvevri, is part of the Intangible Heritage
of Humanity. Archaeological evidence of the use of qvevri goes back 8,000 years.
They are typically buried in the floor of the cellar or Marani, a semi\-sacred place
to most Georgians and found in almost every house. The tradition plays a vital role
in everyday life and celebrations, and forms an inseparable part of the cultural
identity of Georgian communities.

### Georgian music

Georgian culture gives pride of place to the magic of polyphonic singing and its
ancient tradition. The songs traditionally pervaded all areas of everyday life.
The Chakrulo song is one of the most common, sung at ceremonies and festivals. Other
songs are linked to winemaking and date back to the eighth century. The Naduri relates
to work in the fields and incorporates the sounds of physical effort into the music.
This singing, its layers of notes crisper and fresher than ice melt is still very
much alive in Georgia today.

### Bagrati Cathedral and Gelati Monastery

Bagrati Cathedral is located on a hill above the Rioni River and reached by a long,
winding stairway. Although partly destroyed by the Turks in 1691, its ruins remain.
Richly ornamented capitals and fragments of piers and vaulting can be seen scattered
throughout the interior.

Gelati Monastery is representative of the 'golden age' of medieval Georgia. It's
of special importance for its architecture, mosaics, wall paintings, and its enamel
and metal work. It was not simply a monastery \- it was a centre of science and
education, and the Academy established there was one of the most important centres
of culture in ancient Georgia.

### Historical Monuments of Mtskheta

The historic churches of Mtskheta are a testament to human ingenuity, outstanding
examples of medieval religious architecture in the Caucasus. Mtskheta was the ancient
capital of Kartli, the East Georgian Kingdom from the 3rd century BC to the 5th
century AD, and was also the location where Christianity was proclaimed as the official
religion of Georgia in 337. The property consists of the Jvari Monastery, the Svetitstkhoveli
Cathedral and the Samtavro Monastery. The churches contain archaeological remains
that tell a story of art and architecture and the social, political, and economic
evolution of this mountain kingdom for some four millennia.

### Upper Svaneti


![](/library/content/img26.jpg)

Preserved by its long isolation, the Upper Svaneti region of the Caucasus is an exceptional
example of remarkable mountain scenery with medieval\-type villages and tower\-houses.
The village of Ushguli is the highest settlement in Europe at 2300m and still has
more than 200 of their very unusual and well preserved houses. These towers were
used both as dwellings and as defences against the invaders who once plagued the
region.
