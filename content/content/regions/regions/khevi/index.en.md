### History


The name of this province, literally meaning "a gorge", comes from the early medieval
district of Tzanaria. The people of Khevi are ethnic Georgians called Mokheves.

Khevi has long been of great strategic and military importance due primarily to its
proximity to the Darial Pass which connects North Caucasus with Transcaucasia.

Free of typical feudal relations, they lived in a patriarchal community governed
by a khevisberi (i.e. "gorge elder") who functioned as a judge, priest and military
leader.Â When the area was placed under the control of the semi\-autonomous Duchy
of the Aragvi, it was met with fierce resistance by the communities, a story which
has become famous in local folklore and classical Georgian literature. The people
of Khevi retained their medieval traditions and a unique form of society until,
under Soviet rule, many families were forcibly removed to the lowlands.

### Geography and climate


Khevi is located in the Kazbegi district of the Mtskheta\-Mtianeti region. Situated
on the northern slopes of the Greater Caucasus Mountains, the mountainous landscape
of Khevi is dominated by snowy peaks, alpine meadows dotted with rhododendron forests,
plunging ravines, thundering waterfalls and soaring above it all, the colossal Mount
Kazbek. A popular tourist destination, the area is part of the projected Khevi\-Aragvi
Biosphere Reserve.

Long winters and short and cool summers are typical to this region and snow permanently
covers the mountain peaks.

### What to see and do


Travellers are particularly drawn to Khevi for its extraordinarily dramatic alpine
landscape and the centuries\-old churches, monasteries and fortifications that perch
so wonderfully amongst it.

The area's important cultural sites include the Gergeti Trinity Church, a significant
altar of the 14th century on the slopes of Mount Kazbek, Garbani Church, the Sno
fortress, Sioni Basilica and castle and the ancient Betlemi Monastery Complex, its
monks are said to have entered by climbing a long iron chain.

Khevi is home to the Kazbegi National Park, an ideal base for hikers, mountaineers
and for those who just appreciate the awe\-inspiring views. Don't miss the stunning
Dariali Gorge or the Gveleti waterfall. Mount Kazbek is considered one of Georgia's
must do climbs suitable for fit climbers and hikers. The park is also rich in wildlife
and visitors can be lucky enough to see endangered species such as East\-Caucasian
aurochs, chamois and mountain eagles.

Often referred to as the Georgian Dolomites, the big shouldered Chaukhi massive is
on the border of three regions of Khevi, Khevsureti and Gudamakari. With its many
summits over 3300\-3700 m and gorgeous alpine meadows, Chaukhi is one of the most
popular climbing and trekking areas in Georgia.
