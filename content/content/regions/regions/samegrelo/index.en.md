### History


Samegrelo is home to the Megrelians, a distinctive sub group of Georgians who have
their own language and traditions. In ancient times Samegrelo was a large part of
the Kingdom of Colchis, featuring in Greek mythology as the rim of the world and
the mysterious country where the Argonauts sailed in pursuit of the Golden Fleece.
It was also in Colchis that the first Georgian money was minted – the Colchian tetri.
In the 16th century, Samegrelo was ruled by Georgian dynasty, Dadiani, their castle\-like
palace can still be visited in Zugdidi.

### Geography and climate


The region is divided into a low\-lying land to the west around the major seaport
of Poti and a hilly northern section bordering Svaneti. The main rivers are the
Rioni, Enguri and Tskhenistskali. The Kolkheti National Park covers a large area
of the coastal plain within the region, with more than half the park made up of
significant wetlands and lakes.

Zugdidi is the main city of the region and its administrative centre. The city of
Poti on the Black Sea is the main port and trade centre of the country.

The climate of Samegrelo along the Black Sea coast is subtropical, with hot summers
and mild winters. The average January temperature is around 7C° while in July it
commonly reaches 24C°.

### What to see and do


The palace of the Dadiani family, former dukes of Samegrelo, is now a museum complex
located in Zugdidi. As well as 19th\-century paintings of the Caucasus region, fine
furniture, crockery and other historical flotsam, the showstopper is one of Napoleon
Bonaparte’s three bronze death masks. The palace garden is planted with rare trees
and bushes, brought from different parts of the world and well worth a stroll.

Zugdidi is also home to some of the best food in the country. It is typically much
spicier than elsewhere in Georgia and includes dishes that almost taste like curry
so be sure to sample the local specialties. The bustling city also serves as an
ideal stepping stone for getting to Svaneti or Abkhazia.

For outdoors enthusiasts, boating tours, notably on Lake Paliastomi and the Pichori
River are offered in the enchanting Kolkheti National Park, as well as diving, bird
watching, hiking and horse riding. Samegrelo is also rich in karst limestone caves
and a real paradise for speleologists.

For travellers with a penchant for archaeology and architecture, there is plenty
to see throughout the region. One outstanding attraction is the village and archaeological
site of Nokalakevi. It is thought to be the site of the mythological city of Aia,
capital of the Kingdom of Colchis. The ruins of ancient palaces, Christian churches,
baths, and tunnels have all been identified and preserved.
