Georgia is an ancient Christian land and former Soviet republic, uncrowded and unexplored,
offering a mystery as ripe and familiar as late summer fruit. The country is divided
into nine administrative regions, two autonomous regions and the capital city, Tbilisi.
Each place has its own inimitable soulÂ \- from the relaxed bustle of the cosmopolitan
capital to tranquil mountain villages and subtropical seaside resorts. Visit Georgia's
regions and fall under the spell of a land steeped in folklore and the traces of
ancient civilisations.

Feel a potent prickle of excitement in Racha\-Lechkhumi's outdoor playground. And
