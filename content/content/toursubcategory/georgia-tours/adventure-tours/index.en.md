For the ultimate thrill, immerse yourself in Georgia's phenomenal backyard begging
for an outdoor adventure. Go wild. Head out on foot, soaking up the forested mountainsides.
Follow serene trails through thickly wooded glades, past ancient stone castles or
catch your breath on high winding mountain paths. Raft past thundering waterfalls
down hidden river valleys and don't miss the mountain biking, with an endless range
of epic tracks all to yourself.

Georgia is home to a prodigious array of formidable mountains, some of the highest
in Europe, and the holy grail of mountaineering. Float down past the snowy peaks
under a paragliding wing or head underground to explore an impossible world of caves,
caverns and lakes. For those who prefer their adventures in the open air, take a
tour on horseback through flower\-strewn summer meadows. The rich diversity of flora
and fauna is exceptional, perfect for botanists, birdwatchers and wildlife enthusiasts.
