TikaTours is a Georgian luxury tour operator for discerning travellers seeking life\-changing
travel experiences. Established in 2001, we pioneered the concept of luxury travel
in Georgia and the Caucasus region. Our luxury properties enable us to create private
ultra\-luxury holidays at unbeatable value. We were honored to host a famous American
football player \- Larry Darnell Fitzgerald Jr., an Indonesian celebrity chef \-
Farah Quinn and a popular American tennis player \- Barbara Smith.
17 years later, we remain privately owned and our unmatched experience, expertise,
and close relationships allow us to combine experiential service — such as a private
journey through the Caucasus with insider\-access opportunities unlike any you have
experienced before.

<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6"><!-- 3014 -->

Our bespoke journeys range from the lavish to the adventurous \- and no TikaTours
passage is complete without that pleasant unpredictability, which inevitably makes
your travel experience life\-changing. We provide attention to the smallest details
starting from morning tea preferences to pillow preferences when turning in for
the night. TikaTours has been built on a tradition of high quality service and attention
to detail established by Tika Svanidze Vancko – founder and president.
