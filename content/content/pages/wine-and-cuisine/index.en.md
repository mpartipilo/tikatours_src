It’s midday in the foothills of Georgia’s Caucasus Mountains. Green slopes thin out
into alpine meadows and below, a broad beautiful valley uncurls with row upon row
of golden vineyards. Considered by many to be the birthplace of wine, more than
500 indigenous grape varieties are cultivated here.

Georgia has been making wine for 8000 years \- it is a matter of pride, a symbol
of hospitality and deeply rooted in Georgian national identity.

Georgian wine is still produced using the unique and traditional style of qvevri.
Made of red clay, the enormous vessels are shaped like vases with wide shoulders
tapering down towards a pointed bottom. Harvesting, or Rtveli, is done in autumn.
The pressed grapes are put into the qvevri which are buried beneath the ground with
only their necks protruding. No chemicals or yeast are added. When the cover of
a qvevri is finally prised from its airtight seal, a sweet aroma will fill the air
and your first sip will taste of butterscotch, as bright as the morning sun.

Nothing tells you more about the spirit and culture of a country than its food and
wine \- and Georgia’s is among the best in the world. Eating and drinking is always
a celebration with the banquet or Supra at the heart of Georgian life. Whenever
it takes place, a tamada, or toastmaster, will be selected to officiate \- you have
to be eloquent, funny and able to hold your drink.

In between drinks, linger over a feast of vivid culinary colour, from freshly baked
local bread, tomato salad, Georgian kebabs, organic pork and lamb dishes, nuts and
aubergines, to chicken in garlic sauce, salty white cheese, bread stuffed with cheese
and beans, and baskets full of locally produced pomegranates, pears and peaches.

With influences from both eastern and western food and cooking styles, each historical
province has its own distinct culinary tradition. While meat plays an important
part in Georgian cuisine, close attention is also paid to the locally produced salads,
vegetables, fruit and greens.
