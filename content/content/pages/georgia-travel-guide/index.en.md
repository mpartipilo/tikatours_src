Wedged snugly between Europe and Asia, bordered by the Black Sea and the towering
peaks of the Caucasus, Georgia is a fusion of influences from East and West but
retains a culture unlike any other. Falling away from its snowy spine is a surprising
tapestry of rumpled green hills, uncurling rivers and golden vines. With its ancient
heritage, a choice of mountains or sea, and a reputation for superb wine, feasting
and unfailing hospitality, Georgia is a rewarding destination for every traveller.

Walkers, climbers and skiers will want to explore the mountains, forests and traditional
villages. The rivers are perfect for fishing and rafting while botanists and bird\-watchers
will be captivated by the incredible diversity of plants and wildlife. But Georgia
is also famed for its beautiful churches and fortifications, from honey\-coloured
monasteries decorated with frescoes to cave cities hollowed from the country's backbone.
And the polyphonic singing simply must not be missed. Georgia is a land unspoilt,
uncrowded and waiting to be discovered.
