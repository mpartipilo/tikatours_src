Georgia has a complex, time worn history. It was one of the first countries in the
world to officially adopt Christianity and viticulture here can be traced back 8,000
years. The oldest links to modern man found outside Africa were discovered in Georgia
\- the remains of a 1.8 million year old hominid. Combine all this with a Mediterranean
climate, over 2000 mineral springs and legendary Georgian hospitality and you have
an idyllic, exotic travel destination.
