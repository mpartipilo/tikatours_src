Passports are required for visitors of all nationalities, valid for at least 90 days
following your departure date from Georgia. However, it's strongly recommended to
travel with 6 months validity on your passport at all times. You must also make
sure your passport has blank Visa pages. Most destinations, including Georgia, require
that you have adequate un\-used pages in your passport, allowing for any necessary
stamps upon arrival and departure.

Finally, check with your airline in case you have connecting flights overseas as
part of your journey to Georgia. It may be the case that countries you pass through
en route to your destination will require a separate transit visa. Georgia has a
liberal visa regime which includes a visa waiver for the citizens of many countries
for short\-term visits (not exceeding 90 calendar days in any 180\-day period).

Following is a list of the countries whose citizens do not need a Visa to enter and
stay on the territory of Georgia for 90 days:

All countries of the European Union \- United States of America \- Canada \- Japan
\- Switzerland \- Lichtenstein \- Norway \- Israel \- the Holy See \- Principality
of Andorra \- San\-Marino \- Republic of Iceland \- United Arab Emirates \- State
of Kuwait \- South Korea \- State of Qatar \- Kingdom of Bahrain \- Oman \- Brunei
\- Singapore \- Australia \- Monaco \- New Zealand \- The Bahamas \- Barbados \-
Antigua and Barbuda \- Trinidad and Tobago \- Seychelles \- Botswana \- Croatia
\- Chile \- Saint Kitts and Nevis \- Argentina \- Malaysia \- Mexico \- Uruguay
\- Mauritius \- Panama \- Costa Rica \- South Africa \- Brazil \- Thailand \- Belize
\- Saudi Arabia \- Nationals of CIS Countries (except Russian Federation and Turkmenistan).

If you’re not from one of the above countries, Georgian visas are issued in diplomatic
missions or consular offices of Georgia abroad and in exceptional cases they can
be issued at the state border.

Passengers on cruise ships that stay for less than 72 hours do not require a Visa.

of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia.
