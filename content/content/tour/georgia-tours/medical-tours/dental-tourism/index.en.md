Dental tourism is the practice in which people seek for dental treatment outside their local healthcare systems. It is a viable alternative for people living in countries where the price for dental treatment is high, compared to the average income. The growing demand for affordable dental procedures abroad have made Georgia one of the top destinations in the world. The price for treatment is much lower, but the quality standards are just as high as in any Western country.

## Why Georgia?

### Safe Treatment

Georgian dentists are among the best trained in the world. Georgian dental clinics use the latest equipment and procedures.

### Money Saving

The cost of implant treatment in the most renowed Georgian clinics are comparable to the cost of treatment in the statistical UK dental office. The cost of typical treatment in the UK, Scandinavia and Germany is comparable to the cost of world's best and most known Georgian dentistry.

### Top-Class

Through the use of modern methods of treatment and first-class equipment treatments at Georgian clinics are quick and minimally invasive. As a result, even the most complex operation quickly return to work and everyday pleasures.
