meet you to take you to your hotel where you can relax after your flight.

### DAY TWO (June 16): TBILISI TO MESTIA


After an early breakfast at the hotel, we depart for Svaneti. It is a drive of 420km
but we break up the journey with two stops. The first is Mtskheta, the ancient capital
of Georgia and one of the country’s oldest cities. Remains of buildings here have

UNESCO world heritage sites). We arrive into Svaneti, located in the Northwest of
Georgia, and travel to Mestia in its very centre, in time for dinner. Accommodation
is at Hotel Tetnuldi.

### DAY THREE (June 17): CHALADI GLACIER TREK


Today is our first day of walking; a half day trekking tour to the Chaladi Glacier

enjoying dinner at the hotel.

### DAY FOUR (June 18): MESTIA TO ADHISHI


A 45 minute drive takes us to Mulakhi (Zhabeshi), where the people dwell in the gorge
of the Mulakhura River, famous for its multitude of towers. From here we take a
trekking tour to Adhishi, a highland village 2040 metres above sea level and 27km

Mountains, with the landscaped dominated by medieval monuments. Your accommodation

### DAY SEVEN (June 21): USHGULI TO BATUMI


We return to the town of Mestia before heading down the Batumi Black Sea coast, with

developed in the late 19th Century as the western terminus of a railway from Baku
(Azerbaijan) that at the time carried one\-fifth of the world’s oil production.
Batumi gained free\-port status with over 20 foreign consulates set up here, and
