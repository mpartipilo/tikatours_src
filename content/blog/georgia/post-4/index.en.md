Run to your local supermarket.  The ingredients we need for this Georgian treat are
listed below:

* 350 grams of ground beef
* 350 grams of ground pork
* 1 small onion \- do mince
* 1⁄3 cup minced fresh flat\-leaf parsley

With this mishmash, you can make up to 40 dumplings. Note that an average person
eats up to 8 dumplings.

**How to prep**

**1\. The dough**
Place the flour in a large mixing bowl. Gradually add up to 1¼ cups of warm water,
working with your hands until you have a rather stiff dough. Place on a floured
surface and knead the dough for 5 to 6 minutes, until it is smooth. Place the dough
in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Set aside to rest for 30 to 40 minutes.

**2\. The meat**
In a large bowl, combine the ground beef and pork. Add the onion, parsley, chili
powder, 1 teaspoon of salt, and a dash of pepper. Set aside.

Working on a lightly floured sur¬face, roll the dough into a thin layer (about 3mm
thick) and cut it into rounds with a diameter of 7,5cm. Roll each round into a paper\-thin
disk, about 14cm in diameter. Dust the rounds with flour and lay them on a board,
slightly overlapping.

Working on a flat surface, place 2 tablespoons of the meat filling in the center
of each round. Bring the dough up around the filling, pleating the dough with your
fingers and then twisting it into a knob to seal it.

18 to 20 minutes.
