After strolling the Abanotubani (an area in Old Tbilisi full of traditional Sulphur
baths) for half an hour, we met a Dutch couple that recommended us the bath on Grishashvili
Street 11.
Gasping for breath (you had to go up\-hill), we made it to the address. Anna and
I both chuckled a bit. There was a restaurant (hooray) just next to the bath.
We weren’t hungry, but the ambiance was so seductive that we immediately decided
to change plans. The space itself \- and the views – won us over. We decided to
write about it.

Small disclaimer; we’re no food or wine experts, nor writers but we do have a self\-proclaimed
good taste and Marani was something that belonged on our we\-got\-a\-good\-taste\-list.

Upon entry, the hostess of the night friendly welcomed us. I’d describe the vibe
as chilled and hip. The restaurant’s luxurious setting wasn’t dissuasive and we
immediately felt at place. Not many restaurants in Tbilisi (trust us, we’ve been
to plenty) have an open kitchen and this was something that caught our eye.
Since it was early, the restaurant was not crowded and we were fortunate to choose
our own place. We decided to settle down for a table that gave us a magical panoramic
view of old Tbilisi.

**At the table**
Our server was Sergo; a blue\-eyed, cute tall guy. He introduced himself, handed
over the menu, and gave us all the details we needed for the night. The table was
decorated simple, yet luxurious.

**Wine & Dine**
Looking at the menu, the restaurant served a wide range of diverse dishes including
authentic Georgian and European meals.

We kicked the evening off with Pkhali. Pkhali is a traditional Georgian dish of chopped
and minced vegetables, made of cabbage, eggplant, spinach, beans, beets and combined
with ground walnuts, vinegar, onions, garlic, and herbs and can be found in any
Georgian restaurant. However, Marani's version was something out of the ordinary.
Something that really aroused our taste buds. The mood was set.

For the main course, we went with the ''mango/beef salad'' and '' calf's cheeks''.
Sorry for the not\-so\-beautiful\-pic. I couldn’t wait Sergo recommended us a bottle
of red wine (Château Svanidze's Mukuzani) that would compliment the food.  According
to him, and later confirmed by Google, Château Svanidze's wine is organic, award\-winning,
and produced in small quantities. The combination of the main course and the wine
was phenomenal. I just couldn’t find no other word for it.

We ended our evening with a lovely dessert. If you love chocolate, Marani’s smooth,
delicate and delicious lava cake is something you should definitely try. This gloriously
gooey chocolate cake was served with ice cream. Totally worth the calories.

**Lo\-ve\-ly**
Compared to other restaurants in town, Marani isn’t cheap, but then again, ‘'cheap’’
and ‘’brain surgeon’’ do not go together either. Service was so lovely, prompt and
non\-intrusive, and the dishes so relentlessly excellent, that it’s hard to quibble.
So lovely that we repeated the whole process the next day, and the day after, and
the day after.
