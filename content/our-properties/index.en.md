Georgia is the birthplace of wine country, where winemaking began around the fifth
millennium BC. From the Georgian language, the word “wine” spread to other European
languages. Georgia is the only country in the world where wine is kept in clay vessels
called “Qvevri”. This ancient method of wine making and storage is inscribed on
the UNESCO list of cultural treasures.

The Château Svanidze offers a rare opportunity to experience the fascinating centuries\-old
wine history of Georgia. The Château is located in the town of Signaghi \- a famous
corner of wine region, which is called the city of love. From here comes the story
of Geogian painter Niko Pirosmani, who fell in love with a French actress so deeply
that he sold his house to give her one million roses.

The town of Signagi is beautifully situated on the top of the hill surrounded by
a spectacular, defensive wall and is considered to be the second longest wall after
the Great Wall of China. Each of the wall's 23 towers is named after a nearby village.
The towers were places of refuge for the town's inhabitants during sieges.

The Château Svanidze is well\-hidden from the road and opens up into a nice little
oasis as soon as you walk through the entryway from the parking lot onto the lawn.
Here, you will be offered to unwind in the privacy of the Château Svanidze with
incredible views over the snow\-capped Caucasus Mountain range. From this exclusive
retreat among astonishing natural beauty, feast on fine cuisine prepared by renowned
chefs, enjoy premium local wines and experience the Kakheti region at its opulent
best on a private guided tour.
