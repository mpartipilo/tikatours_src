Follow ancient footsteps, from the shores of the Caspian Sea to the soaring peaks
of the Caucasus Mountains. Each country has a unique culture, history and traditions,
from the legendary landing place of Noah’s Ark to monasteries precariously perched
on mountaintops, Georgia's famed vineyards and Azerbaijan's strong Persian influence.
These three Caucasus countries boast a wealth of historical treasures, indelible
scenery and endless opportunities for adventure.

The oil soaked land of Azerbaijan contains significant prehistoric rock carvings,
mud volcanoes, pink salt lakes and palaces of glorious stained glass. Explore the
capital, Baku with its opulent opera houses and theatres and the walled Old City,
stuffed with cafés and carpet shops. Neighbouring Georgia has world class wines,
spectacular religious sites sculpted out of the cliffs and unparalleled hiking opportunities.
Yerevan is the cosmopolitan capital of landlocked Armenia with its Mediterranean
feel, exotic flea market and striking stone churches.
