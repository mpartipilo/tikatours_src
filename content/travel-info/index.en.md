Georgia sits on the edge of Europe, semi\-shrouded in myth and legend. It is off
the well trodden tourist trails but in recent years, international visitors have
risen sharply. Word is spreading about the warm welcome and unique travel opportunities
that Georgia offers. Whether you come to Georgia for the outstanding hiking, skiing,
music or ancient monuments, you'll experience an exotic, unspoilt paradise of mountain
fortresses, old vineyards and grand city boulevards.
