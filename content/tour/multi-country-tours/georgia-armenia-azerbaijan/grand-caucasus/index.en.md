Welcome to Caucasus! The three highland countries of the Caucasus straddle a stunning
strip of snow\-capped mountains wedged between Black and Caspian seas. The Caucasus
region holds a wealth of views and warm hospitality from its inhabitants. Experience
the places you have only read about.

Begin in Azerbaijan and follow in the footsteps of Silk Road traders and Crusaders
from shores of the Caspian Sea and the marvelous history of Baku, through the magnificent
wine fields of Kakheti and up to the spectacular High Caucasus mountains. Continue
on a scenic drive over the border with Georgia to the capital of Yerevan with a
European feel. The complex of cathedrals at Etchmiadzin and the Khor Virap Monastery
will showcase the incredible Christian heritage of the country, while the Hellenistic\-era
Garni Temple goes farther back into history.

These three distinct countries and a wealth of history and culture can be found on
the 14\-day luxury journey through the Grand Caucasus.
