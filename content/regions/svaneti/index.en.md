### History


In ancient times, Svaneti was part of the Colchis Kingdom. The myth of the Greek
Argonauts’ voyage to Colchis is thought to be connected to the gold of Svaneti.
Svans used sheep wool to capture the gold from the rivers \- the wool was fixed
to a board that was placed into water, wool side up. Once removed from the water
and dried, the gold would fall from the dry wool.

Svaneti periodically gained independence and had its own ruler and tribal councils.
Settlements grew out of large family farms and brotherhoods were created as big
families divided.

Svan religious beliefs and traditions were tied intimately to the fields. They have
great respect for rituals which often feature deities protecting cattle and people,
and granting fertility.

### Geography and climate


Svaneti is divided into two parts, Upper Svaneti and Lower Svaneti, separated by
the Svaneti Mountain Range and running between the Enguri and Tskhenistskali Rivers.
The region boasts several 4000\-5000m high peaks.

At 2000 meters above sea level, the climate of Upper Svaneti is humid and cold.
Temperatures in January average approximately \-6 °C and16 °C in July.

### What to see and do


The tower settlements and fortresses in Svaneti are one of its most notable attractions.
Originating in the early middle ages, they mirror the austere, natural ramparts
of the near impregnable terrain,erupting from the rock and cliffs around them.

Ushguli is home to the remnants of one of the most ancient fortresses of Svaneti,
dating from the reign of Queen Tamar.  Ushguli itself is one of the highest settlements
in Europe and like the towers and churches of Svaneti, is under the protection of
UNESCO.

Tourists interested in religious culture will find fine examples of wall paintings
and icons from the Middle Ages in the churches around Mestia. The Church of Christ
in Lagami is a good example of traditional basilica style architecture and is well
known for its frescoes. Etseri and its surrounding villages are also known for their
churches including one of the most dazzling, the 10th century Pkhutreri Church of
the Archangels.

Most of the treasures of Svaneti can be enjoyed in the Historic and Ethnographic
Museum of Mestia. Highlights include icons from the Middle Ages and late 19th century
photographs of Svaneti’s landscapes and settlements that documented the daily lives
of the local inhabitants.

The Latali region has earned a reputation for its talented musicians and during festivities,
as well as during mourning, visitors may have the opportunity to listen to these
spine\-tingling polyphonic songs.
