Surrounded by hills, sliced in two by the Mtkvari (Kura) River, with tree\-lined
boulevards, charming lanes, towering churches and pastel\-painted houses, Tbilisi
is unexpectedly lovely.

Like a lovely lost kingdom, Georgia's capital city lies deep in the country's heartland,
watched over by ancient towers and churches. The central city unfurls along Rustaveli
Avenue, the intriguingly eclectic architecture reflecting Georgia's dynamic history.

<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-6"><!-- 1549 -->

Broad and leafy streets, grand neo classical buildings and space\-age modern designs
sit alongside ancient churches, mosques, synagogues and a teasing maze of twisting,
balconied side streets. Here and there, honeysuckle blossom and mulberry trees give
shade to surprising courtyards.

### History


Founded in the 5th century, the city has always attracted people from around the
world, illustrating Georgia's ancient role as a merging point of cultures along
the Silk Road. Today, most trips to Georgia start in Tbilisi, often striking travellers
as both reassuringly familiar and genuinely exotic. The name Tbilisi derives from
the Old Georgian word "Tpili", meaning warm and was given to the city because of
the area's numerous sulphuric hot springs.

### Geography and climate


Located in East Georgia, this city of approximately 1.5 million people sits within
a large basin surrounded by hills. The Mtkvari River slips purposefully through
its streets.

The summer months in Tbilisi are long, dry and hot and the winters are relatively
cold. July is the hottest month with an average temperature of 24 °C. January is
the coldest month with an average temperature of approximately 1 °C and snow falls
on average 15–25 days of the year.

### What to see and do


Take the new cable car up to the 17th\-century Narikala citadel for a bird’s\-eye
vantage over the city and a close\-up of the oversized Mother Georgia statue and
her gaze of steely self\-assurance. Explore the spidery lanes of the old town with
its ornate balconied houses and Byzantine churches or spend a relaxing afternoon
in the beautiful tiled surroundings of one of the city's ancient bath houses, immersed
in the hot springs that bubble up beneath the city.

Stroll through Maidan Square, Tbilisi's historic center, with its outdoor cafés and
bars. Breathe in the thick sweet smell of incense at Kashveti Church on Rustaveli
Avenue. Visit the shiny trappings in the National Gallery of Georgia next door and
indulge in a night of luxuriant dreams at the Marjanishvili Theatre, housed in a
curvaceous Art Deco building.
