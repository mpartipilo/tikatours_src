### History


The region's history dates back to ancient times. 3500 years ago the powerful and
well\-known Colchis Kingdom was established in western Georgia with its unique culture,
education, political and military system. Archaeological excavations have exposed
many valuable objects including stunning gold jewellery, agricultural tools and
weapons from this period which can be seen at a special archaeological museum in
Vani.

### Geography and climate


This central western region of Georgia borders the Likhi Mountain Range to the east,
Tskhenistskali River to the west, the mountainous region of Racha\-Lechkheumi to
the north and Meskheti or Persati Mountains to the south. The forests and meadows
in this region teem with wildlife.

The Imereti lowland is part of the Kolkheti Valley and enjoys a sub\-tropical sea
climate.  Winter here is mild, while the summer is hot.  The average annual temperature
is 11\-15 degrees Celsius.  Upper Imereti has colder winters with more rain.

### What to see and do


Imeteti is home to two of the most unique masterpieces of Georgian architecture,
the Bagrati Cathedral and Gelati Monastery Complex, both of which are protected
by UNESCO and shouldn't be missed by visitors to Georgia. Bagrati Cathedral, now
in partial ruins, stands watch over the attractive city of Kutaisi and has been
the home of Colchis kings since antiquity. The Gelati Academy and Monastery was
one of the biggest religious, educational, scientific and philosophical centers
of Georgia.

There are also numerous lesser known but intriguing historic and cultural landmarks
dotted throughout Imereti. The Ubisa Temple is one of the most important examples
of Georgian monumental painting while the striking Mgvimevi Monastery appears sculpted
from the side of a cliff by butter knives. At Katskhis Sveti there are two mysterious
churches built above a 40m high cliff. Thought to have been the home of hermit monks
who came from the Middle East, they can only be reached by a testing climb up hanging
stairs,

The colourful villages of Imereti also have a special charm, each with their unique
characteristics to explore, from cool chambers of aging wine to the homes of pottery
and Georgian cognac.

The Borjomi\-Kharagauli National Park is a must see for outdoor enthusiasts. One
of Europe's true wildernesses, it covers more than 76,000 hectares of native forest
and sub\-alpine and alpine meadows, and is home to rare species of flora and fauna
including lynx and golden eagle.

Sataplia Reserve is an example of Georgia's karstic landscapes and the magic that
happens when water meets limestone \- grottos and caverns with the most gorgeous
display of stalactites, stalagmites and mineral rock curtains. Over 200 footprints
from dinosaurs have been discovered here. When you go, be sure to check out the
local museum.
